Hi Everyone,

This is a simple project I will do from Freecodecamp's HTML and CSS Responsive web design course. I build a Tribute page about Vitalik Butirin. I used basic HTML and some CSS.

-->

<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<html>
  <header>
  </header>
  

<style>
  body{
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #FFFFFF;
  font-family: calibri;

  }
</style>
  
  <body>

<div id="main">
  
  <h1 id="title"> Vitalik Butirin: the father of Web3.0</h1>
  
  <div id="img-div">
    <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank" href="https://vitalik.ca/">
    <img id="image" src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/210513120706-vitalik-buterin-file-super-tease.jpg" alt="picture of Vitalik" width="25%" height="25%">
    </a>
    <figcaption id="img-caption"> Vitalik Butirin is a Rusian-Canadian programmer. In 2014 he co-founded the Ethereum blockchain which today, serves as the building block for hosting web3 applications. So it can be save to say Vitalik is the father of web3 right? </figcaption>
    
  </div>
  
  <p id="tribute-info">
